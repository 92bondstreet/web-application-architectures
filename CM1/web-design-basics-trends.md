# WEB DESIGN: BASIC AND TRENDING

> UX, UI Best Practices

UX and UI are not buzzwords. It's a developer day to day priority that can decide if you achieve with success.

The focus on architecture, framework, semantic, SEO... etc help us to control performance, SEO, time rendering, bug free, cross-browsing of a web application.

But the true objective is the **user engagement** in a competitors world.

The engagement could be the purchase or subscription workflow.

## Prototyping

Before to start a sprint to develop a web application, use iteration and prototyping to work on version 0.0 of your product. You product has to work and looks beautiful.

It'a low cost best practice before to go deeper with architectures and frameworks: identify usage, use flow, objectives...

Build your web application that makes sense for the user by minimizing his workflow and offers a consistent experience in its desktop and mobile version.

## Trends

### Notorious big

The power of *Make it big* gives users a maximum impact.

Full screen and high qualityt images drives consistency for your branding.

*Make it big* principle is also true for typography. How? By reducing the number of fonts and by using different size to get the message across. It's also more maintenable.

### Breathe

Don't lost the user in your app with different color gradients or shadows.

Create simpler interface with fewer flat colors to remove all distraction and to help navigation.

User fewer colors highlights key features and gives a better identity and mood.

Using lines and dividers makes your application too dense.

Replace them with space and blocks of centent.

### Data First

A web application focus to a single task: providing quickly information to users.

Increasing font size and highlighting data improve the user engagement.

#### Example

### Micro Interaction and Motion

By using your Web Application, the user should never ask the question:

> But how does it work?

Open a message, find an adress, update settings... motions can capture the user's attention with a *woauw* effect. A good way with motions could be to use micro-interactions.

Micro-interactions is a small and not too obtrusive visual enhancement.

#### Example

![motion](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/532215/screenshots/1796852/rdc_ldp_short-term_v2_animated2.gif)

### Form

Purchase, access, data input... forms are everywhere.

Keep away from browser elements: they are so boring. Use custom elements to minimize the pain to fill them and illuminate the path of completion.

#### Example

![forms](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/6410/screenshots/1254439/form-animation-_gif_.gif)

![forms](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/14827/screenshots/986398/attachments/115047/share.png)

### Innovating scrolling

The click was the first *movement* for page navigation.

With integration of sensors in Smartphones and tablets, users extend the click with real gestures on the screen: swipe up/down and left/right, pinch...

It's obvious but composed click and scrolling will increase your users engagement over mobile devices.

#### Example
