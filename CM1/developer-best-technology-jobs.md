## Tux ? Emacs ? gcc ? Segmentation Fault… WTF !!??!

### Montgallet Street, Paris.

I started to learn code in 2000 at Engineering school with C. 

I’ve just bought my first computer *rue Mongallet in Paris*. The heaven for making Lego with computers: motherboard, HDD, memory, cases…

Windows was my first OS: double-click, windows key + E, Start menu… A new world, a new toy.

Slowly, I can control shortcuts, applications installation and Word, when we started the first programming course. 

### Tux

While  I never touch a computer 6 months before, in few minutes, I saw a penguin, a black screen called terminal, an editor called emacs (*very very different from Word)* and we need to compile source code with gcc. 

!?!! Let’s just say:

> coding === knitting

It took only a few minutes to hear from my classmates:

## Give me a R&D intership. No.

Mathematics was my Major with mechanics and some numerical analysis sugar. 

I selected as first function in Intership job board R&D section in cac40 companies: Dassault, Total, Essilor… Nothing for student.

To find intership, only developer jobs. Nothing in mathematics or very few.
