# DEVELOPER TOOLBOX

> Artisan? Yes, we are.

Dentist, plumber, mason, artisans... they all have one thing in common: tools !

They can take several years before to find the best tools but once found the can work faster and more efficient.

## Manifesto for Software Crafmanship

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

* Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**
* Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**
* Not only individuals and interactions, but also **a community of professionals**
* Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.


## Tools

### Paper and Pen

Take notes.

Draw. Cross out. Organize. Plan your day.

Sometimes, you can take hours and hours to solve problems or issues. You'll try to fix all code source lines without the right results. Come back to fundamentals: take a paper and a pen, keep away from screen and keyboard.

The paper offers you an other point of view for the creation process.

### A good Editor

A developer without editor is as a TV without colors: it doesn't make sense.

Find a good editor according your sensitive: open source or not, minimalist, plugin-ables, customizable... Compare them choose one and seize it.

You editor is like your house: you know where is kitchen, bathroom, rooms... and you don't find barrier on your path to open the fridge door.

The editor should give you quickly access to files, projects, color theme and scheme modification, code completion, syntax hightlighting, linting...

### Terminal

The Command lines are useful helpers for Developers productivity.

Git command, test runners... editor and terminal work together.

With a white or black background, with full or minimalist versioning informations for your files, take the time to customize it.

Example with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

```
Oh My Zsh is a way of life! Once installed, your terminal prompt will become the talk of the town or your money back!

Each time you interact with your command prompt, you'll be able take advantage of the hundreds of bundled plugins and pretty themes.

Strangers will come up to you in cafés and ask you, "that is amazing. are you some sort of genius?"

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you always felt that you deserved. ... or maybe you'll just use the time that you saved to start flossing more often.
```

The next step would be to use `Tmux`. Tmux enables from the same terminal screen to run a number of simultaneous and separate terminal instances.

### Browser

The daily of front developers could be:

> When I click on submit button nothing happened?

> Could you try to improve the layout?

Before to open all packages dependencies of a Web application, open your browser Developer Tools.

It means, you have to master at least 1 Web browser.

### Dotfiles, aliases and automation

Dotfiles are configuration files that are hidden from the system.

Dotfiles help to customize the default behaviours of your programs.

You can also create aliases as shortcuts for git or script for repetetive tasks.

For example, my [osx.sh](https://github.com/92bondstreet/dotfiles/blob/master/osx.sh) file allows me to (re)install my developer environnement from scratch on Macbook.

### Agile

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.


### You

Know yourself.

Do something to change your life, your close family and friend, the world.
