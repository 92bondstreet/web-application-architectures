> Drive more, pay less

## Decreasing pricing for longer rentals

To be as competitive as possible, drivy decide to have a decreasing pricing for longer rentals.

### New price rules

* **price per day** decreases by **10% after 1 day**
* **price per day** decreases by **30% after 4 days**
* **price per day** decreases by **50% after 10 days**

Adapt the rental price computation to take these new rules into account.

```js
{
  "rentals": [
    {
      "id": "paul-bismuth",
      "price": ?
    },
    {
      "id": "rebecca-solanas",
      "price": ?
    },
    {
      "id": "sami-ameziane",
      "price": ?
    }
  ]
}
```
