## Rental prices

My brother chooses a price per day and price per kilometers for their 3 cars.

The driver then books the car for a given period and an approximate distance.

The rental price is the sum of a time component and a distance component with

* **time component**: the number of rental days multiplied by the car's price per day.

- **distance component**: the number of kilometers multiplied by the car's price per km

```
rental price = time + distance
```


Write code that generates the price for each `driver` from `data.json`:

```js
{
  "rentals": [
    {
      "id": "1-pb-92",
      "price": ?
    },
    {
      "id": "2-rs-92",
      "price": ?
    },
    {
      "id": "3-sa-92",
      "price": ?
    }
  ]
}
```
